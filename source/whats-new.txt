What's New in 1.10.1
--------------------

The 1.10.1 driver patches a bug that affects Client-Side Field Level Encryption 
and Queryable Encryption. The bug can cause data corruption when rotating 
:ref:`Data Encryption Keys <csfle-key-architecture>` (DEKs) encrypted with a 
:ref:`Customer Master Key <csfle-key-architecture>` hosted on Google Cloud Key 
Management Service or Azure Key Vault. The bug was present in version 1.10.0 of 
the driver in the ``RewrapManyDataKey`` method and causes the loss of DEKs.

.. important:: Back Up your Key Vault Collection

   Always back up your :ref:`Key Vault Collection <csfle-reference-key-vault>`
   before you rotate your DEKs. If you lose your DEKs, you lose access to all
   the data encrypted with those keys.

What's New in 1.10
--------------------

New features of the 1.10 Go driver release include: 

- Added full support for MongoDB 6.0.
  
- Support for new features related to :ref:`qe-manual-feature-qe`,
  including new options to ``AutoEncryptionOpts`` and ``EncryptOpts``. MongoDB 
  v6.0 or later is required.

- Support for the new Queryable Encryption shared library, which removes the 
  need for the ``mongocryptd`` process. The queryable encryption shared library 
  requires `MongoCrypt <https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.mongodb/mongodb-crypt>`__
  version ``1.5.1.2`` or later.

- Added :ref:`clustered index <golang-clustered-indexes>` creation support.

- Added a new API and ``ClientEncryption`` entity operations for encryption 
  key management.

- Added a new ``Timeout`` client option to set a default context timeout.

- Performance optimizations including:
  
  - Improved full document requests for before and after updating change stream 
    events.

  - Improved PRN and UUID generation 

  - Reduced memory consumption when compressing wire messages.

- Added troubleshooting support for `frequently encountered issues 
  <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-go-driver/blob/master/docs/common-issues.md>`__

New features of the 1.9 Go driver release include: 

- Improved connection storm mitigation.

- Added ``Custom```` options to aggregate and change stream operations.

- Added a ``Let`` option to most CRUD commands that specifies parameters for use 
  in an aggregate expression context. ``Let`` must be a document that maps 
  parameter names to values that are constant or closed expressions without 
  references to document fields. MongoDB v5.0 or later is required.

- Added new constructor functions that create ``Cursor`` and ``SingleResult`` 
  instances from marshalable and non-nil BSON documents.

New features of the 1.8 Go driver release include:
