.. _version-1.10.1:

What's New in 1.10.1
--------------------

The 1.10.1 driver, along with the 1.5.2 ``libmongocrypt`` release, patches a bug 
that affects Client-Side Field Level Encryption and Queryable Encryption. The 
bug can cause data corruption when rotating 
:ref:`Data Encryption Keys <csfle-key-architecture>` (DEKs) encrypted with a 
:ref:`Customer Master Key <csfle-key-architecture>` hosted on Google Cloud Key 
Management Service or Azure Key Vault. The bug was present in version 1.10.0 of 
the driver in the ``RewrapManyDataKey`` method and causes the loss of DEKs.

.. important:: Back Up your Key Vault Collection

   Always back up your :ref:`Key Vault Collection <csfle-reference-key-vault>`
   before you rotate your DEKs. If you lose your DEKs, you lose access to all
   the data encrypted with those keys.

.. _version-1.10:

What's New in 1.10
--------------------

New features of the 1.10 Go driver release include: 

- Added full support for MongoDB 6.0.
  
- Support for new features related to :ref:`qe-manual-feature-qe`,
  including new options for automatic and manual encryption.

- Support for the new Automatic Encryption Shared Library, which replaces the 
  ``mongocryptd`` process. The shared library requires MongoDB v6.0 Enterprise 
  or later and ``libmongocrypt`` 1.5.0 or later.

  -  **Warning**: Calling ``RewrapManyDataKey`` with ``libmongocrypt`` 
     versions less than 1.5.2 that may result in data corruption. Use 
     ``libmongocrypt`` 1.5.2 or higher when calling ``RewrapManyDataKey``.

- Added :ref:`clustered index <golang-clustered-indexes>` creation support.

- New API and ``ClientEncryption`` entity operations for encryption key 
- management.

- Added a new ``Timeout`` client option to set a default context timeout for 
  each operation sent thorugh that client.

- Defaulting data to either ``primitive.M`` or ``primitive.D`` when decoding 
  empty types.

- Support for encoding atypical map key types for data that can be unmarshalled 
  into a textual representation of itself. 

- Performance optimizations including:
  
  - Improved full document requests for before and after updates in change 
    stream events.

  - Improved PRN and UUID generation 

  - Reduced memory consumption when compressing wire messages.

- Added troubleshooting support for `frequently encountered issues 
  <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-go-driver/blob/master/docs/common-issues.md>`__


.. _version-1.9:

What's New in 1.9
-------------------

New features of the 1.9 Go driver release include: 

- Improved connection storm mitigation.

- Added ``Custom```` options to aggregate and change stream operations.

- Added a ``Let`` option to most CRUD commands that specifies parameters for use 
  in an aggregate expression context. ``Let`` must be a document that maps 
  parameter names to values that are constant or closed expressions without 
  references to document fields. MongoDB v5.0 or later is required.

- Added new constructor functions that create ``Cursor`` and ``SingleResult`` 
  instances from marshalable and non-nil BSON documents.


.. _version-1.8:

What's New in 1.8
-----------------

New features of the 1.8 Go driver release include: 

- Added full support for MongoDB 5.1.

- Support for KMIP (Key Management Interoperability Protocol) as a KMS 
  provider for client side encryption. 

- Redesigned driver connection pool for low operation ``Context`` timeouts and 
  to reduced connection churn. Behavior changes include: 

  - New connection creation times out at ``connectTimeoutMS``.

  - At most, two new connections are established at the same time.

- Removed oppressive and unncessarily gendered language in the Go driver 
  documentation, code, tests, and spec tests. 

.. _version-1.7:

What's New in 1.7
-----------------

New features of the 1.7 Go driver release include:
